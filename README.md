# audiospool
The <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003/10/bloggercon-live-video.html">original podcast downloading script</a>, when they were still called audioblogs. This downloads a feed and puts the audio files into a playlist in iTunes, for you to sync with your iPod.

You'll need a copy of <a href="https://github.com/kevinmarks/feedparser">feedparser</a> in the same folder, but this does still work, as Chris Lydon's feed is still up. 

Mind you, I haven't synced an iPod with iTunes in years
